// to install django either install it directly or make a requirements.txt file which
would contain all the dependencies, and the run that file using

// Creating a Django Project
1. create an project -> django-admin startproject project_name
2. Changes in settings.py:
    -> under STATIC_URL add:  STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'
    -> under the ALLOWED_URLS add '.pythonanywhere' & '127.0.0.1' since it would be deployed there

    A model is a special kind of object that is saved in the Database
    Creating an application:
        -> python manage.py startapp app_name
6. Saving the application in settings.py
    Under installed_apps add a line: 'app_name'
7. To add a model to the database, use the following commands:
        -> python manage.py makemigrations app_name : (here blog)
        -> python manage.py migrate app_name
8. To add/edit/delete posts, we would use Django Admin
    -> from .models import Class_name(here Post)
    -> admin.site.register(Post)
9. To access the Django Admin we have to create a superuser, one who has control over everything on the site
    -> python manage.py createsuperuser
10. Deploying the website
